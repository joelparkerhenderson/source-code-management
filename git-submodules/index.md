# Git submodules

IIRC the Git people seemed to reject the idea of large code bases. Or, rather, their solution was to use Git submodules. There was (and maybe is?) parts of the Git codebase that didn't scale because they were O(n). Apologies if I'm misspeaking here but I peripherally followed these discussions on HN and elsewhere years ago as someone from the outside looking in so I'm no authority on this.

The problem of course is that Git submodules don't give you the benefits of a single repo and I've honestly not heard anyone say anything good about Git submodules.
