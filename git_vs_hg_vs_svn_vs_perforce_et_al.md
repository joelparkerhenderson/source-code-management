# Git vs. Subversion vs. CVS vs. Perforce etc.

Many open source projects have migrated to git. 

A lot of companies don't use git.

People switched to Git because Subversion merging continues to suck, and branching and tagging are implemented on the most inane way possible.

Why have many projects switch from CVS, Subversion, etc. to Git?

  * Git is fundamentally built on more powerful ideas than what came before it.

  * Git makes it easier to branch, merge, tag, and do distributed source code.

  * GitHub makes it easier/cheaper to host open source projects, fork, and comment.

  * Standardizing on one VCS makes it easier for more people to contribute.
